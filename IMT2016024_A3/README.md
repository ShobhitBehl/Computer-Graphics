# 3D Object Rendering
A simple program to render multiple 3D objects and applying basic object centric tranformations like scaling, translating and rotating. Also implemets diffuse and ambient lighting. Option to display wireframe mesh and circle splats.

## Program Usage
To compile and execute, go to the directory of the Makefile and run on terminal 
'''
make run
'''

To move the light source, use keys 'w','s','d','a','q','e' to vary x,y and z coordinates positively and negatively respectively.

To translate the object, left click on the object and drag mouse to desired position.

To scale object, click on the object(left or right) and use '+' and '-' to increase and descrease scale respectively.

To rotate object, right click on the object and drag mouse in the direction of rotation.
